Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V <P><BR>is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
<P><BR>Everything I do
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
</P></BR>Like I'm reckless</P></BR>
I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

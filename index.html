Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake</P>
<P>My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better    
But now I got a bellyache</P>
<P>everything I do
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace</P>
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm reckless</P>
I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
